Calling the OSM-API and displaying selected data

I call the OSM-API as the challenge requested. 
Then the data is converted to GeoJSON and since I did not just want to display the file i decided to see what could be displayed nicely.
So i iterate over the GeoJSON and filter out all names (excluding the nameless features) and display them in a simple grid.

This is all done in JS although my main language is JS, hence the code might be a little bit rough around the edges.
I decided as a frontend theme to add a little aviation humor, use similar border radius and the same font as the site of the company that gave me this challenge. 

Please explore and have a look here: https://tim-86.github.io/OSM-API/

I hope you enjoy this :)
